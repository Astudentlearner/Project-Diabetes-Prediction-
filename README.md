# Pima Tribe Diabetes Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze various aspects of diabetes among the Pima tribe by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

## Background
Diabetes is a significant health concern globally and has been found to be prevalent among the Pima tribe. This project utilizes a dataset that includes medical records of Pima Indian women and attempts to uncover underlying patterns related to the instances of diabetes.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following attributes:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating if the patient has diabetes

## Analysis
The project involved the following steps:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the distributions and relationships in the data
- Model Training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes

## Results
The models' performance was evaluated based on accuracy and the number of true positives and negatives. Logistic Regression provided a slightly higher accuracy, while the Random Forest model was more sensitive in predicting true diabetic cases.

## Conclusions
The findings of this analysis could help in understanding the diabetes prevalence among the Pima Indian women and assist in early detection and prevention strategies.
